<!--Description: Enables users to automatically reject incoming calls from anonymous parties who have restricted their caller identification. You can enable the Anonymous Call Rejection feature using configuration files or the Web Configuration Utility. After you enable the feature for users, users can turn call rejection on or off from the phone. When a user turns Anonymous Call Rejection on, the phone gives no indication that an anonymous call was received.-->
