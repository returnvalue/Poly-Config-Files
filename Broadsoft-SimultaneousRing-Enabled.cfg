<!--Description: The Simultaneous Ring feature enables users to add phone numbers to a list of contacts whose phones ring simultaneously when the user receives an incoming call. When you enable the Simultaneous Ring menu option on the phones for users, users can turn the feature on or off from the phone and define which numbers should be included in the Simultaneous Ring group. -->
