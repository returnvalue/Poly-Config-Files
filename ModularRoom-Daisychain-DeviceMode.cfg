<!--Description: Applying this config to a Trio will reboot the Trio and place it into device mode.  Trio will no longer be provisioned by the configuration system and will instead be listed as an available device to pair with over Modular Room Protocol for Daisychaining Trios.  Leverage the Modular Room Auto Pairing Configuration Profile to prestage automatic pairing of Daisychained Trios.  To undo this setting on a Trio, you must change the value directly on the device, or through a factory restore.  -->
