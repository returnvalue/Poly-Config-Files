<!--Description: Schedule the device to reboot at a specific time, or during a window of time.  If timeRandomEnd is defined, the device will reboot randomly during the window of time between 'time' and 'timeRandomEnd'.  All times are based on the device's local timezone and clock.  The 'period' defines at what interval the device will reboot, between 1 and 365 days.  The period is restarted at any device reboot.-->
